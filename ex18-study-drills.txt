When you run ("use" or "call") a function, check these things:

1. Did you call/use/run this function by typing its name?
   - Yes. typing print_two("Zed","Shaw") calls the function by its name
2. Did you put the ( character after the name to run it?
   - Yeppers
3. Did you put the values you want into the parenthesis separated by commas?
   - Yes I did
4. Did you end the function call with a ) character?
   - Alwasy!
5. Functions that don't have parameters do not need the () after them, but would it be clearer if you wrote them anyway?
   - Yes I think it is clearer to write them that way. This makes it clear that what you are calling is a functionand not something else
